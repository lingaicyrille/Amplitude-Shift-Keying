<h1>Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Amplitude-shift keying (ASK) is a form of amplitude modulation that represents digital data as variations in the amplitude of a carrier wave. In an ASK system, a symbol, representing one or more bits, is sent by transmitting a fixed-amplitude carrier wave at a fixed frequency for a specific time duration. Project consists of a simple showing an ASK diagram.
